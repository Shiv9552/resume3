abstract = {Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a concept in the area of computer networks in which the control plane and data plane of traditional computer networks are separated as opposed to the mechanism in conventional routers and switches. SDN aims to provide a central control mechanism in the network through a controller known as the SDN Controller. The Controller then makes use of various southbound Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to connect to the physical switches located on the network and pass on the control information, which used to program the data plane. SDN Controller also exposes several northbound APIs to connect to the applications which can leverage the controller to orchestrate the network. The controller used with regard to this paper is the Open Network Operating System (ONOS), on which the algorithm in question is to be deployed. ONOS provides several APIs which is leveraged to connect the application to the network devices. The typical network path between any two endpoints is a shortest path fulfilling a set of constraints. The algorithm developed here is for optimal K-Shortest path searching in a given network satisfying specified constraints, controlled by ONOS.},

abstract = {Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly. The scope of this paper is to study and compare various supervised learning models and make an attempt to classify the best performing one based on accuracy, precision and recall score metrics.},
